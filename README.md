NMRA DCC based Controllers and Decoders PCB designs.

##Components

Please see the README.md file for each component inside the repository.  The files included are board and schematic files for [CADSoft Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/)

##Usage

Feel free to use, update, and change the files as you want.  Please keep in mind these files were created with a hobby license and as such should never be used for commercial purposes.

##Installation

Download and install Eagle first, then download each component files.  Open and modify as needed.

##Build

If you want a physical board, you may use any one of a number of suppliers.  I typically use [OSHPark.](https://oshpark.com/)
